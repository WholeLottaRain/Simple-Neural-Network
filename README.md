# Simple-Neural-Network
A simple neural network, which determines the probability of an event based on some other. In this case, the probability of a student going out on the street when several factors are combined (exams are taking place, friends are calling for a walk, the student is ill, etc). You can change the number of runs the training speed.


STEPS
1. Train NN: Enter your cases in txt file (example: there is rain, no holidays, not sick, no friends, need to go to the doctor, there is exams, student goes outside - 100011, 1)
2. Enter number of trains
3. Enter learning speed
4. Press "Train"
5. Test NN
6. Enter your case to test
7.  Check the result
